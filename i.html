				Who am I?

				Hello, my name is Pedro Costa and I am the creator of CPetec.<br>
				I'm 15 years old and I'm a student of ETESP (ETEC from São Paulo) studying 1st year of ETIM Systems Development,
				yes i'm only 15 years old, this proves that anyone who wants can pass on knowledge to other people.<br>
				I created this site to help people who want to study at an ETEC but for some irrelevant reason,
				They can't afford a cram or don't have time for it.<br>
				Another reason I created this site is very simple, it is my module completion work (TCM) a project
				that everyone in my class has to do, this project will be a component of my fourth
				failure to do so would result in my disapproval.<br>
				Well, there's nothing to talk about me, I'm in the process of learning and that's why this site is far from being
				perfect, but I promise that over time I will improve it.<br>
				An interesting thing is that I learned a lot from doing this site, things I didn't learn in class and things that
				I never imagined what I could do, man I made an 80 page site and I'm sure if you use it as
				study base you will pass the ETEC you want (assuming that this site is only an aid to facilitate your research
				and studies). <br>
				Going back to the beginning, I study at ETESP and there is a very good school (there are its mistakes and it is far from amazing because it is from
				but still good), the teacher who taught me how to program websites is amazing if you come to study at
				course I please value his classes. The name is Evandro Teruel, he has a youtube channel where he teaches
				about encryption and bitcoin investing. I will leave the following link: <br>

				Thank you for your attention, Pedro.
